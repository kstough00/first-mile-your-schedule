# Your schedule

# Weekly Curriculum Assignments
Lessons and labs will be released under your active track at the start of each module. The expectation is that students complete all of the labs and lessons released by the end of that module. Some lessons will be marked as “BONUS.” We recommend that you complete those lessons only after you have completed all other lessons and labs. Weekly curriculum assignments will be communicated via the Learn homepage (you can click on the Learn icon in the top left corner to access the Learn homepage).

# Weekly Study Groups
Study Groups are a great way to deepen your understanding of a concept as you participate in live discussions with instructors and your peers. Study groups for each cohort will be held weekly, and will cover topics relevant to the lessons and labs assigned that week. They will be held on the following schedule: 

|          | Monday         | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday |
| ------------- |:-------------:| ----------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Full-Time** | | 11am - 12pm ET | 11am - 12pm ET | 11am - 12pm ET | 11am - 12pm ET |
| **Part-Time** | | 6pm - 7pm ET |  | 6pm - 7pm ET |  |

In addition to the cohort-based study groups, supplemental study groups will be hosted by additional members of the Online Instructional team. These will vary in day and time from week to week and are optional. For more information about study groups, refer to the Study Groups section below.

# Weekly Pair Programming
Pair programming is a highly valuable skill of a Software Engineer, and is commonly used on dev teams to optimize the end product and share knowledge across the team.  We want to provide you with as many chances to meet and collaborate with fellow cohort students as possible. 

Every Monday, students in your cohort will be paired to work on a lab determined by the Cohort Lead. Pairings and the recommended lab to pair on will be communicated via the Learn homepage (click on the Learn icon at the top left corner of the page to access the Learn homepage) beginning Week 3. Cohort leads will also be hosting Pair Programming Study Group sessions to provide opportunities for pairing.

# Cohort Calendar
The Google calendar for your cohort will live on your Learn homepage (click on the Learn icon at the top left corner of the page to access the Learn homepage). This calendar will be a high level overview of the coming weeks and months and will include dates (and times) for study groups, events, holidays, portfolio project due dates, and anything else that might be important from a time standpoint. You can add this Google calendar to your Google calendar by clicking the “+Google Calendar” button on the bottom right corner of the calendar.

# Scheduled Breaks
Full-Time and Part-Time cohorts have a one-week break in instruction between Modules 3 and 4. Part-Time cohorts also have a one-week break in instruction between Modules 4 and 5. 

During these breaks, there is no formal instruction or study groups.

# Technical Mentorship
Students will meet weekly with their Cohort Leads - and we ask you to come prepared to these meetings with specific questions in order to make the best use of time. An Instructor meeting can be catered to address your unique challenges each week and can include: 
* Discussing a topic/lab you struggled with during the past week
* Pairing on lab(s) you are currently working on
* Instructor testing your knowledge on the topics covered that week 
* Planning/supporting your project work during a Project Week
* Identifying additional work to help reinforce topical areas of improvement

# Study Groups
Study Groups are a great way to deepen your understanding of a concept as you participate in live discussions with Technical Coaches and your peers. Live discussion solidifies your understanding of code as you strengthen your skills to communicate technically. 

You can view upcoming study groups here: [https://learn.co/study-groups](https://learn.co/study-groups), and will see two types of study groups listed.

- Study group(s) run for a particular cohort (led by their Cohort Lead)
- Study group(s) run by the Instructional team (marked as supplemental)

For study groups that are run specifically for the cohort, a recording will be made available via a link on the main Learn page. The recording will be available to those that would like to review a study group or if they are unable to attend live.

Additionally, a repository of previously recorded study groups can be viewed here: [http://instruction.learn.co/student/video_lectures#/](http://instruction.learn.co/student/video_lectures#/).
